Well, well, well. Fancy seeing you here. Come on in and I'll tell you all about our comings and goings. Have a seat. Allow me to be introspective for a moment. This was my first month of working remotely. The people I'm working with are "A players", which is simultaneously very good and very stressful because I also have to put forth my best effort, and I often feel like an idiot. But you know what? This is exactly the kind of environment I want to be in. I have a tendency to throw myself in uncomfortable situations for the sake of education. "Real" education isn't always fun and often comes at a price. At my last job, I started off overwhelmed and I left a year-and-almost-a-half later because I had gotten too comfortable. That and I outgrew my salary. I have this ever-present concern, perhaps even a fear that my growth will stagnate and I won't learn as much as I should, and that someday I'll wake up and realize I'm like the programmer who learned UniBasic in the 70's and never learned anything new and is now obsolete in the marketplace. Speaking of dust storms, here's a picture of one. ![IMG_1492](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1492.jpg) We went to an amazing **Andrew Jackson Jihad** show, which served as a record release show for their new album. I believe the show sold out, as when we showed up and bought our tickets, they said there were only 43 tickets left. To demonstrate how much I love this band, I recently compiled a list of my [favorite 100 songs](https://dallincoons.wordpress.com/2016/08/29/top-100-songs-100-91/) in which I probably have more of their songs than any other band. I didn't want to take a picture during the actual show because that would just be stupid, so Emily took one of me in between sets of the opening bands so that I could share my excitement with all the world: ![IMG_1505](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1505.jpg) Birds! Pidgeons made a home on our balcony and laid eggs. I know, many people  view pigeons as vexing pests, but we don't go on our balcony in the summertime, are you crazy? So we may as well view nature take its course. Shhhhhhh. Look its hatching ![IMG_1511](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1511.jpg) Speaking of animals, I don't like cats. But cats like me apparently. ![IMG_1515](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1515.jpg)![IMG_1519](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1519.jpg) Just for the record, dogs are a 1,000,000,000,000,000 times better than cats. But cats are ok if there's nothing else around. We're nerds! So we went to a UX TV show taping. For those of you who don't "habla Espanol", UX is a dumb and inaccurate acronym for User Experience. You know when you go to a website and you can't frickin' find anything but it's a government website or something so there's no competitors and they didn't feel the need to hire any User Experience people? Or when you visit something like Amazon and you have a 20% chance of accidentally buying because it's so easy? Anyways, this "TV show" which is more like a youtube show, was about exactly that. They had people who built websites and apps compete for whose is easiest to use! Riveting! ![IMG_1532](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1532.jpg) And we look super fancy! All right! ![IMG_1542](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1542.jpg) WOW! ![IMG_1543](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1543.jpg) One day, we went to Tuscon to attend a surprise 85th birthday party for my Grandpa. In case you don't know, Tuscon is a land of tumbleweeds and saloons, where the dresscode is cowboy hats and flannel and you have to say stuff like "howdy pardner". Oh and did I mention that if you wear a tie, they'll cut it off and hang it up! 'Cause that's how it's done in the Wild West. ![img_0318](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0318.jpg) In the West, there's certain rules for how to eat your cake: ![IMG_1567](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1567.jpg) That feeling when there's no more cake to be had: ![IMG_1573](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1573.jpg) We went and watched some folks jump off roofs and blow stuff up: ![IMG_1578](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1578.jpg) Here's the posse ![IMG_1600](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1600.jpg) And meanwhile, the birds just kept getting bigger ![IMG_1583](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1583.jpg) My GOSH I'm sexy ![IMG_0302](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0302.jpg)                                                                                                 ![IMG_1573](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_1573.jpg)
