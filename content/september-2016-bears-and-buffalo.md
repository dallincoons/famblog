One normal, average morning Emily went outside to find...all the cars missing in the parking lot? Did somebody still everybody's cars? Nope. The pavement needed a manicure and so someone towed every car to the other side of the building without warning us(!). I'm far more amazed, even impressed, that someone actually did this than I am put off by the confusion and slight inconvenience. ![img_0345](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_0345.jpg) Everyone needs a giant teddy bear in their lives. Just ask Random Dude and Creepy Emily. ![img_1771](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_17711.jpg) We went to Utah for two weeks in September to visit family and Emily's dog, Morgan (more on that later). On our drive, we encountered an atomic bomb explosion.![img_0327](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_03271.jpg)![img_0333](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_03331.jpg) These are not gross! They're not! Why do you think they're gross? ![img_0335](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_03351.jpg) Aah another Legacy game, this time of the Risk variety. Your actions in one game affect the board, cards, etc and all future games. You rip up cards, you write on the board. I can't tell you more than that or I would have to kill you! ![img_0322](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_03221.jpg) Look how much FUN we're having! FUUUUUUUN ![img_1617](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_1617.jpg) Focus!! FOCUSSSS! ![img_1619](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_1619.jpg) In other news, Emily turned into a Troll. ![img_1669](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_16691.jpg) And we got to see Shauni and Jordan! We played Ticket to Ride Europe and we discovered that Emily's sister Cassi lived very close and so she joined us as well. It was fun to meet their dog Banana and see their awesome garden and eat spaghetti with sauce made from their garden. Jaren and Emily discovered that our Camry is actually an LE despite it looking janky. ;) ![img_1679](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_16791.jpg) This is Morgan. Emily's family got her over 10 years ago and was Emily's companion on many a walk. ![img_1692](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_16921.jpg) Recently though her health started to decline and she was diagnosed with leukemia. ![img_1699](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_16991.jpg) The family made the tough to decision to not let the disease get to a point that really put her in pain. ![img_0324](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_03241.jpg) And so we spent a week hanging out with her and everyone else. We took her and Tim the cat on walks. (How cool is it that the cat went on walks with us?) ![img_1753](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_17531.jpg) Gave her lots of pats. ![img_1761](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_17611.jpg) And then said goodbye. She's happily chasing buffalo in doggy heaven now. ![img_1764](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/img_17641.jpg)   Farewell Morgan, you will be missed. Bon Voyage.
