It's the end of the year, and things have happened. I wrote about my job search here, which ended up having a happy conclusion. In September, I was brought on board SpotOn as a software engineer, using a language called Go. I'm a newcomer to Go, but it was a language that interested me and 6 months before I started this job, I bought a book on Go and started solving programming puzzles through exercise.io, as well as writing my own app for analyzing expected moves in the stock market. Finding a new job is uncomfortably close to dating. There's a lot of trying to make things work with prospective relationships even after seeing red flags, and not feeling comfortable while not even realizing you're not comfortable. When I interviewed with SpotOn, I know talking about salary is taboo, but I don't think it should be. I asked for 90,000 and got it.
