Well and bravely stated Dallin. I understand where you are coming from and continue to be proud to have you as a son in law. I do believe in a just god with infinite love and compassion, although I don't always understand why so much pain exist in this world. That said, I'm confident in a continuation after this life and that we'll remember, and be able to build on, the relationships we've fostered. I think a just god will let everyone continue to learn and grow, especially those who have tried to live by the golden rule... regardless of the specifics of ones faith.
