Last month I left you on a nasty cliffhanger regarding Emily's job. The past several years Emily has worked 3 different places in an office administrative assistant role. Realizing that administrative assistance isn't her life's work prompted her to start learning web design. I was working on a project to help us as a household manage our recipes and grocery lists, and I recruited her to make it look and feel nice and pretty. This past year we decided she more or less has mastered CSS which is what makes sites look pretty, and she decided to delve into the world of javascript, which is what makes websites feel sleek and polished (instead of refreshing the entire page when you login, for example, javascript would enable you to seamlessly transition what's on the screen without needing to refresh). We decided we would try and work a little bit every day on pair programming, where you sit down, looking at the same screen and take turns writing code. We've been building the grocery list app that I mentioned again from the ground up, but with Emily doing all of the CSS and most of the Javascript. As it turns out, when you know how to write code, businesses seem to like that, and she was recently hired on in web design role, and has discovered that she wants to emphasize in web animations, which from my estimation demand for is going to continue to grow, and is currently not a widespread skill. I believe that it's important to find a niche or an emphasis and learn the crap out of it (my emphasis and "passion", I guess, is automated testing, for example). Emily's first day of work ![IMG_0406](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0406.jpg) The highlight of the month was going to Emily's dad's baptism. Emily says: "I've actually had a hard time putting into words how happy I was that weekend. I had never really expected my dad to rejoin the church and had accepted that so when he called me to tell me he was taking the missionary discussions and then that he had set a date it was like I won the lottery or something. Totally out of the blue, but totally awesome." ![IMG_0064](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0064.jpg) ![IMG_8651](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_8651.jpg) Chris was getting his World War II jeeps ready for an off-roading excursion in Moab, Utah, so we were able to take them out for a test drive. ![IMG_0071](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0071.jpg)![IMG_0364](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0364.jpg) ![IMG_1475](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_1475.jpg) ![IMG_0452](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0452.jpg) ![IMG_0429](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0429.jpg) ...and I got to check out the new Mario Kart, and I can confirm it's definitely a Mario Kart game, which means it's awesome. ![IMG_0872](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0872.jpg) We went to a restaurant named after a lizard of all things, Red Iguana. It has some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Highly recommended. ![IMG_0467](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0467.jpg) Emily had a birthday dinner courtesy of brother-in-law Robert's chef skills. (This is actually a picture from a meal provided by my parents a couple months ago, but it looks similar to what we had, so let's just roll with it) ![IMG_0405](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0405.jpg) ![IMG_0487](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0487.jpg) ![IMG_0472](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0472.jpg) ![IMG_0485](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0485.jpg) ![IMG_0478](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0478.jpg) Man, nobody talks these days, they just look at their phones!!!! (people pictured are playing a game that requires technology, and it's a very social game so take off your white wig and stop judging!) ![IMG_0471](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0471.jpg) There's a crazy little game we like to play that involves sticky tounges Emily gets very, very competitive and aggressive when we play games as you can see ![IMG_0484](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0484.jpg) And guess what, it snowed \*shakes fist\* ![IMG_0490](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0490.jpg) We started a game of Pandemic: Legacy Season 2, a game which continually morphs underneath you as you permanently alter the game as you proceed from game to game. When we started the game, we were prompted to name initial starting "haven" cities. So we named them after...cereal? I don't know, we were tired, ok? ![IMG_0409](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0409.jpg) Hey, turns out it rains sometimes ![IMG_0411](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0411.jpg) I traveled to New Jersey to meet my coworkers, some of whom I had worked with for over a year and only knew them from their voice. It was kind of weird experience in which I felt like I was meeting strangers, but I felt like I knew them at the same time. That was literally the first time I had ever traveled east of the Mississippi. I don't get out much. Chicken and waffles are great, by the way. ![IMG_0412](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0412.jpg) That's basically what New Jersey looks like, I'm sure. ![IMG_0414](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0414.jpg) White Castle is gross. It's like McDonalds. ![IMG_0416](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0416.jpg) My sister and brother-in-law, Shauni and Jordan were visiting from Utah so we borrowed Jordans dad's house and had dinner. I took the opportunity to observe the children in the wild. ![IMG_0494](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0494.jpg)![IMG_0495](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0495.jpg)![IMG_0497](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0497.jpg) ![IMG_0500](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0500.jpg)![IMG_0502](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0502.jpg)![IMG_0503](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0503.jpg)![IMG_0504](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0504.jpg) ![IMG_0506](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0506.jpg)![IMG_0505](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0505.jpg)                                         ![IMG_0425](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0425.png)                               ![IMG_0432](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/img_0432.jpg)
