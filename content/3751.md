Our first day or so after the delivery, I wanted to leave the hospital and the relentless stream of people coming through our door. As time ticked closer to our discharge from the hospital, I started to become more nervous about leaving. At the hospital, everything was provided for us. Along with the flood of nurses came all the pain medication and ice packs, and the sometimes-edible hospital meals. Emily just stayed in her bed and everything was taken care of. Kevin was born 7:11 AM on November 26, 2019. That night, maybe around 7 or 8 PM, Emily fed him and I swaddled him and laid him down to sleep. He was quiet for a few minutes before we heard in the dark smacking lips, meaning he wasn't asleep - he was hungry. \*smack smack smack smack\* We turned on the lights, fed Kevin again for 20 to 30 minutes, and I laid him down, hopeful this time he would be ready to sleep. After a few minutes, again we heard the hungry smacking. \*smack smack smack smack\* And we haven't stopped feeding him since. But I'm getting ahead of myself. When we arrived home, it was like being thrown out in the cold. To be clear, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. In order to become self-reliant, there is always going to be an uncomfortable growth period. There's always an initial price to pay to not needing to relying on others, which in turn leads to being in a position to help others. Even if the hospital would let us stay there and take care of us forever, that wouldn't be a good thing for us in the long run. So off we went on our own. That first day and night after we got home from the hospital are seared in my brain.
