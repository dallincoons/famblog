**Simple Man - Bouncing Souls** No this is not a cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd. There's two eras of the Bouncing Souls. The first 5 albums were overflowing of with pure youthful energy and absurdly relatable songs to normal people who are simultaneously excited and scared about life. The latter half of the Bouncing Souls catalog is music from seemingly boring, old, mature dudes. But between those two eras is this album, an album chronicling the feelings of people who are getting older and wiser, but not quite boring and jaded yet.

> I want to be a simple man. With a little peace of mind In a place that's kind

**Dig up her Bones - Misfits** Spooky tune. Michael Graves is not only an amazing singer, he's a highly prolific songwriter as well, as this song demonstrates. Although this isn't classic Misfits, I feel like this song carries on the spirit of what the Misfits are: a band who writes spooky, halloween-esque punk rock songs that are a bit off-color at times. This is a catchy, catchy song. **Heart Cooks Brain - Modest Mouse** This is another song of Lonesome Crowded West and Modest mouse proves again they can weave a tapestry of weird bendy notes and windy musical melodies, as if you were traveling down an empty desert road.

> on the way to god don't know my brain's the burger and my heart's the coal on this life that we call home the years go fast and the days go so slow

**Free Radio Gainsville - Hot Water Music** Chris Wollard belts out this anthem, dare I say manifesto as the opening track to an amazing album, No Division. I love Hot Water Music gives it all they energy they have and leave nothing behind. Just have a looksy at the band performing this song live and witness the ferocity and why I love this band so much. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wykyG5pu4U **A History of Bad Men - the Melvins** The Melvins are the reason why Nirvana even exists. As legendary as they are, so this is one of the only tracks from the Melvins that has really drawn me in. The Melvins are notorious for their challenging music and I'm still struggling with it, but this track is a long, catchy, banger of a song. **Radio - Rancid** This is essentially a love song to music, and it's funner than fun. Just watch everyone explode and start jumping around when they start playing this song: https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMMEcwWajUI

> Never fell in love Until I fell in love with you Never know what a good time was until I had a good time with you If you want to get the feeling and you want to get it right Then the music gotta be loud For when the music hit I feel no pain at all Warm summer night I was drinking with my dad He tried to give me the love that I never had But he gave more love to his bottle of wine So I had to go out and find love of another kind Here it is Here I am Turn it up F\*\*\*ing loud Radio, Radio, Radio When I got the music I got a place to go

**Ripe - Screaming Females** I just started getting into this band this year, and this is a great song off a catchy, emotionally genuine rock album. This female fronted band knows how to rock and write a sick hook. Seriously, check em out (unless you're a tender snowflake who can't handle even the slightest amount of rock). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpWUqTRAW9U **Wake Up - Tim Armstrong** Several years ago I worked with someone who I shared the same musical taste with, and he played this album, A Poets Life, at work one day and I fell in love and I had to buy the album immediately. Essentially this is Tim Armstrong of Rancid fame with the reggae band, the Aggrolites.This was a match made in heaven. I love Tim Armstrong's speech-impediment-sounding voice singing very catchy melodies on top of some fast-paced reggae. This album makes me believe I could close my eyes and I'm in the Bay Area. https://www.youtube.com/embed/1tzEBcZAi8o **Translator - Tim Armstrong** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc\_iFszDRuA **Lady Demeter - Tim Armstrong**

> Ella necessitava una me amigo, I was for hire Esto es lo que quieres, what's your desire And the girl's in the club until they shut it down She's got her crew coming over, thinks she runs the town Things are gonna get crazy, so stick around She's a restless soul, trouble bound
