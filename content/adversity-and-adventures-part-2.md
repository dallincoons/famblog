So yeah Idaho says hi. We went from inner city ghetto in one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the US to...the exact opposite of that. It's been a culture shock for sure. Our lives have also gotten really boring, at least to an outside observer. From the inside its as high octane as ever. I'm still working at the job that I was working at when we left Arizona, I'm just working remotely now. This is both good and bad. The good is that we're able to pay for my school out of pocket and we can keep our 3-month emergency fund in place. The bad is that I feel like I'm not learning anything, at least at my job. But that's sort of why I'm at school so I can continue learning. Actually, it's a little more complicated than that: I had started kicking around the idea of finishing up schooling in some capacity maybe about a year and a half ago. I resisted the idea, not only because we really like sunshine as much as we dislike snow (Emily even more than me) and Arizona certainly checks that box. The real reason is that I believe (and still believe) that a college degree is not a pre-requisite to success. I think maybe there was a weird time in American history somewhere between 1950 and 2000 that you either got a college degree or you worked unglamorously as a blue-collar pion somewhere. I'm telling you people, the coming of the Information Age has changed that. The guy that manages our remote contractors at work doesn't have a college degree, the CTO doesn't have a college degree. My coworkers don't have a college degree. Many of my past coworkers didn't have a college degree. I believe things are changing. In fact, Google, Apple, and IBM many other companies agree with me. They have publicly stated that they _do not_ require college degrees. In fact, some have even praised those without college degrees. Lazlo Bock from Google has said "when you look at people who don’t go to school and make their way in the world, those are exceptional human beings. And we should do everything we can to find those people". He goes on to say "My belief is not that one shouldn’t go to college … most don’t put enough thought into why they’re going and what they want to get out of it". That's the truth, people. I see value in college, I actually really do. I see a lot of value in it as a _supplement_ to your education, nothing more, nothing less. When I was at school the first time, I was like the rest of hordes of college students assuming that somehow college will magically bestow upon them a gift of being a valuable asset to someone. It wasn't until I dropped out and really learned how to gain an education, and became a valuable asset as a result, that college started to make sense again, as an additional educational _supplement._ I would rather that society stops preaching college degrees as if college is the one true way to education, and therefore your only shot to make it in the world. The truth is, and this isn't what most people want to hear, but your education is a sum total of how you spend your free time. I'm really not that smart, but I was able to quadruple my income because I spend my free time learning, instead of watching Netflix and playing Fortnite. There are more distractions and amusements than ever these days, and those who can find within themselves the grit to turn away from the memes and stop watching so much TV, and learn a new skill instead are the ones who intrinsically are going to be valuable in the marketplace. I didn't decide to go back to school because I was stagnating in my career opportunities, I am simply hungry for more knowledge. I see college now as a supplementto help me add to the foundation I've already gained on my own. Here's perhaps a bit more of a specific reason why I'm back: I want to get into data science-y stuff like machine learning and in order to do that, I need to know both math and programming. I do have no doubt I can learn math on my own, but learning math isn't like learning a new piece of technology. Math is just more fun in a more formal setting. Math is something I've avoided my whole life, it's always been the thing I've hidden from. I may even have been guilty of being one of those people using it as a badge of pride. "Hey, I'm really bad at math, everyone!". Well, I'm tired of that. There deeper I get into programming the more I see the utility in mathematics. My goal is to make it through Calculus at the very least. The only problem is my math scores only allow me to get into algebra refresher courses. I don't want to spend all the time and money to get all the prerequisites needed to take Calculus, so my goal is to learn enough math that I can take a placement exam bypass all the preliminary stuff. What I've been doing that past 6 months in addition to my schoolwork is practicing math. I have a few giant books full of algebra and trigonometry problems that I've been working through. Emily jokes that it feels like she's living with a psychopath because it seems like every time she picks up a piece of paper, there are math equations scribbled all over it. Indeed, it turns out that practicing math involves a lot of writing on paper, and I've filled up several notebooks with my crazy math scribbles. It looks like I'm a genius to the untrained eye, but I'm really just refreshing myself on rudimentary algebra and trigonometry. My placement exam is online and I have 5 attempts, and I've been taking the test about once a month. For first two attempts were a bit lackluster, but on my third attempt I got a good enough score to get into Pre-Calculus or the "Calculus for people who aren't really into this math thing" class - but I want to get into "real" Calculus. On my fourth try, I actually was one point shy of the ever elusive Calculus level. I've got one more shot at it, which I have to take by March 22. Don't think I'm scared to write in my next blog post that I didn't make it either. I ain't scared of failure. Besides, I am really proud of my progress thus far regardless. Every now and then I think "what the hell am I doing in Idaho"? We do really miss the sunshine, and I've got a ton of unfinished programming projects and tons of new project ideas that I want to tackle, but I simply don't have any time. But I think we're doing the right thing. Truth be told I'm not even that concerned about necessarily finishing (DON'T WORRY I'LL FINISH...probably). I'm just happy that I'm gaining a better understanding of math and statistics. Especially statistics. Oh my gosh, I never would have guessed how much I love statistics. Yes, I'm still hell-bent on becoming a trader. The only reason I learned programming was to get a salary that would allow me to start putting capital in the market. Oh, and you know what machine learning and statistics are good for? Yup. I've been working with Emily on really honing a trading plan. She's been helping me "backtest" since I'm so swamped. Backtesting is going back in time and recording how well a particular strategy did over the prior months or years. So far in my statistics class, I've been able to run my own analyses on the market and the trading strategies in our plan, with actionable results. If it wasn't for the robbery, I shudder to think to know how long we would have stayed in the rut we were in. Sometimes bad things that happen to you are the best things that happen to you. This is home for a while: ![](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/img_0935.jpg) I haven't been very consistent with these posts lately, so here's me doing my best to catch up: This past summer we made a stop through Vegas with my sister Janae and her husband Mark, and the ever so cute Leah. Mark and Janae both served in the Philippines THEY DIDN'T MEET ON THE MISSION so they have an affinity for Filipino food. We went to an authentic Filipino restaurant with all kinds of crazy food. I really enjoyed it, and I would go out of my way to eat there again. Mark shared his fish-that-still-has-a-head, and they treated us to sort-of-like-mcdonalds-applie-pies-but-way-better. ![](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/img_1188.jpg) Emily has decided that in addition to all the graphic design and programming that she's been learning, she wants to learn guitar. So I finally had to dust off the guitar(s) and my now-feeble guitar skills and try and show her a few things. She's been practicing every night and has been rapidly improving! ![](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/img_4257.jpg) We spent Christmas with Mark and Jane (and Leah), and it was a very nice low-key shindig. We had the experience of putting toys together on Christmas Eve, which yeah is super cliche, but it was fun. ![](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/img_4238.jpg) For Franks birthday, all he wanted was for people to come visit and show him some music they've learned (that's how you do a birthday), so I thought it would be funny to teach the classical sevant a Ramones song. He tried to jazz it up and make it fancy, so I had to explain to him that one does not simply jazz up a Ramones song. You gotta just stick to those three chords. ![](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/img_4160.jpg)                                                 ![IMG_1099](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/img_1099.jpg)
