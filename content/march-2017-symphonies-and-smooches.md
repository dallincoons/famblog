Looks who's back! Did you miss us? You know, I'm terrified of becoming a boring, old, low-energy 9-5 commuter who no longer finds child-like joy in the world. That's partially what the blog is for. It's one of the tools in my toolset to help keep the adventure alive. I've consistently written a blog every month for the past few years. One of the qualities that I like about myself is that I generally have a lot of self-integrity: when I decide to do something, I do it. If I decide I'm going to go to the gym every day, I go to the freaking gym every day. When I decide I'm going to write a blog every month, that's what I do. The past few months however, every time I've sat down to write a blog, I get an overwhelming sense of apathy. That's frightening to me. What's happening? Is this what getting old(er) feels like? Have I officially been inducted into the rat race, of which the requirements for membership are apathy and exhaustion? I don't want that to happen. In the words of one of my favorite bands, Andrew Jackson Jihad: **I want to put on my sweatpants.** **But don't you know I'm trying to quit.** **I want to give a sh\*\* again** I've been acquiring vinyl records at an alarming rate! How much is too much? Should we have an intervention? ![recordshop](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/recordshop-e1488742717646.jpg) ![turntable](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/turntable-e1488742618138.jpg) Look we have friends. You can't tell us we don't have friends, we made sure to take a picture to prove it, so back off! They even do cool things like magic. ![img_2332](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_2332.jpg) When it's raining, the ONLY logical thing to do is to go get ice cream. ![rainyicecream](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/rainyicecream-e1488742578151.jpg) Phoenix/Tempe/whatever in the middle of January. Sometimes we forget heinous and depraved things such as snow exist. ![tempe](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/tempe-e1488742670303.jpg) ![twochocos](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/twochocos.jpg) I came across this picture the other day of myself and some old buddies in my preferred environment. No cars, not technology, no people - except cool people. Wow, look at those muscles! mmm mmm mmm ![ountainman](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ountainman-e1488742747891.jpg) Do I even need to comment on this! NO ![merica](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/merica-e1488742787644.jpg) If you're going to live in the desert, you really should have a giant cactus in your front yard. You really should. ![bigccactus](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bigccactus-e1488742910548.jpg) Arizona sunsets!!!!!! ![azsunsets](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/azsunsets-e1488742936343.jpg) ![azsunset](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/azsunset.jpg) California sunrise!!! ![californiasunrise](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/californiasunrise.jpg) Dogs are learning how to drive!!! ![doogroof1](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/doogroof1-e1488742857785.jpg?w=3025)![doogroof](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/doogroof-e1488742883710.jpg) Someone left us a little St. Patricks Day surprise. Thanks! But please don't ever do that again! Damn alcoholics... ![throwup](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/throwup.jpg) We attended the Phoenix Symphony because I thought they were playing The Planets by Gustav Holts. As it turns out they played a smattering of various spaced themed classical pieces, including Mars from The Planets. Darth Vader made an appearance to conduct the Imperial March. ![darthvader](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/darthvader.jpg) Aaand Superman. Because Superman I guess is from a different planet or something? ![superman](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/superman1.jpg) Emily's brother Keaton were married in March. They didn't want to go the same old conventional route, and so they decided to get married in In-N-Out!! Hey, why not? ![marriedatinnout](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/marriedatinnout.jpg) Here's the birthday boy! ![lunch](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/lunch.jpg) Look at theses smug people though, it makes me sick! ![goodgroup](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/goodgroup.jpg)![ralycool](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/ralycool.jpg) With all the love in the air, you can't help a couple guys getting a little carried away! ![canyoufeelthelovetonight](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/canyoufeelthelovetonight1.jpg) There's no excuse for these pictures! ![purseman2](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/purseman2.jpg) ![weddingsarefun](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/weddingsarefun1.jpg) Then the cops showed up. ![cops](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cops1.jpg) With as much fun as we were having at the wedding, we never wanted it to end, but unfortunately, we had to go home :( Amazingly enough, the next week we attended a wedding for my sister Megan. They were married on the top of a mountain at Lowell Observatory under a giant telescope where they first met. Not as original as In-N-Out pretty good! ![meganwedding](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/meganwedding.jpg) People are getting married left and right! Well I'm back in the saddle folks. See ya next month.                                   ![stolesomething](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/stolesomething.jpg)
