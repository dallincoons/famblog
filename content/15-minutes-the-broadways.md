I drove to my stupid job today, got stopped at an intersection 15 minutes of my life just rolled away I looked at the guy next to me he didn't seem so happy no ones happy but everyone's too busy to see let's go shopping today drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls and for lunch we'll have big macs I wish I could turn the clock back to when I was ten when I wasn't scared of everything and everything wasn't so f\*\*\*\*ing crowded and I wonder if my kids will ever see a horizon untouched by billboards and shopping malls and I wonder if this crazy world thinks I'm the one who's crazy what if I'm the one who's crazy? I'm not crazy just frustrated
