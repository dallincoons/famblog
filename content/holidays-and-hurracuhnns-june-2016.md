We've been working on the design phase of an recipe and grocery list web app named Pepper Rodeo that we are building. We've determined that we want to spend 90 percent of our time designing it and so when it comes time to code it, you can bang out the code in no time flat. That's something I learned at college. See? Sometimes college isn't always a waste of time. Basically we created as many "Use cases" and "User Stories" as we can think of. From there we went through all the nouns and talked about whether it was a candidate for it's own class in the system (jargon warning). We then looked through all the verbs and wrote down methods and attributes that may belong to the classes (jargon warning). I should probably stop. I am working on a [technical blog](http://dallincoons.github.io/) which I hope to document the whole process. ![IMG_0593](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0593.jpg) You know what, enough of that boring stuff, let me show you pictures of our super sick-as-in-cool vacation in Hurricuhn, UT. This trip really helped motivate us to get out of the big city. Somehow, someway, we're going to figure out how to do it. Note: sorry for the lack of wordage in this blog post. I used too much of my blogging energy on this monstrosity: \[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3poDe7GRpyE&w=560&h=315\]   ![IMG_0577](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0577.jpg) Invigorating![IMG_0568](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0568.jpg)![IMG_0566](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0566.jpg)![IMG_0559](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0559.jpg)![IMG_0558](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0558.jpg)![IMG_0557](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0557.jpg)![IMG_0555](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0555.jpg) Robert?
