Great update Dallin! I certainly need to read more... the “fast food” social media time has cut into my real reading time more than I like to admit.

I suspect it's not just you :) Reading books is great, but takes extra discipline these days. We really got back into the habit of reading with the Kindle app, and now we each own our own Kindle.
