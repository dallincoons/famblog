[Songs 100-91](https://dallincoons.wordpress.com/2016/08/29/top-100-songs-100-91/)   The Passenger - Iggy Pop We're jumping in the way-back machine for this one: 1977. The legendary Iggy Pop. This is a slower meandering tune. I can visualize myself cruising down the highway underneath the stars. The pacing, the melody, and the lyrics come together to perfectly capture this feeling. I recommend this song to the non-punkers out there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLhN\_\_oEHaw Our Own Way - Hot Water Music Ah, we're getting gruffer with this tune. This is probably my favorite band of all time. I remember listening to  years ago and my mom mentioning that the singer really needs to clear his throat. That's about right. This song is a good example of why I love the band so much. It's gruff, it's gravelly, it's noisy, but it's really positive and always makes me happy.

> We've seen some real hard times and I hope the hardest are behind but there will be times when it will seem like we are caught someplace in between the ocean and the storm without a shore we'll find our own way home and sing out every song we know no one can keep us down and who gives a f--k what anybody says we'll live and love until we're dead holding on to what we've come to know

> Jackhammers outside my window woke me up again today And all the voices in my head well it's so hard to make them go away looking for some new stimulation, but all of these things, they just never last I know I have to move forward, but I keep holding on to the past I just wanna be happy with the way things are I just wanna look up at the sky at night, and appreciate the stars

> Nothing ever happens here, but everything has changed

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl\_8T-MMDqo Modest Mouse - Out of Gas Here's another not-really-punk tune! Modest Mouse's 'The Lonesome Crowded West' is one of top five albums of all time. Isaac Brock grew up in a small town that at one point got overrun by malls and commercialization, which pissed him off. That's where the inspiration for much of this album comes from. Many Modest Mouse songs are about driving long distances or are at least analogies with driving as the central theme. Out of Gas is a good example of this.

> Out of gas Out of road Out of car I don't know how I'm going to go I had a drink the other day Opinions were like kittens I was giving them away

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkqqwOX9dGM   Touche Amore - The Great Repetition This is about as close as I get to Hardcore, which is basically punk with a harder edge to it, but this band is not your typical Hardcore. The lyrics are so painfully introspective and emotional that if went another couple inches in that direction it might be cringe worthy. I always thought this song was clever and interesting with its imagery. At around the 40- second-mark everything goes quiet except the vocalist who belts out the most emotional line of the song. Now I know, that sounds like it would be some horrid emo crap, but it works somehow. After a minute and forty-eight seconds, there's nothing else that needs to be said.

> With intermission ending, the finale is approaching It's not what you're expecting, cause you're all involved Now will you take your seats, and be quiet please I need all eyes on me, as I try to explain: This is my final act so I'll need your full attention And for my final trick I'll make everyone who loves me disappear But I won't know how to bring them back Alone I'll stand on this stage No one to care, myself to blame An act with no conclusion That's me up there That's me: repetition

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbYKNj3EbMs   Rivers Cuomo - Longtime Sunshine This song is the most honest and vulnerable of just about any song I've ever heard. This song was the fruits of a moment in time after Rivers Cuomo, the frontman for the nerd rock back Weezer, decided he didn't want to be a rock start anymore after the success of their debut album. He was accepted into Harvard and thus prompted a sort of identity crisis, and an amazing batch of songs was a result. This song was written in 1994 but never officially released until 2007. I love this song!!! Check it out!!!!!!11 (It gets kind of weird toward the end because this was originally intended to be part of an ambitious rock opera that never really came to fruition)

> Sometimes I wanna pack it all up, get on a bus and move to Vermont or Maine, or any of those states back east that I remember sometimes I wanna go back to school to an east coast college with some history I'd be satisfied, I know, in the simple things

https://youtu.be/o8TyGGFUlhM   Anchors Aweigh - Bouncing Souls I believe his song is basically about getting old and being nostalgic and stuff. It has an interesting pacing to it that you don't often get from punk bands. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv7U5mGDpsc Disorganized Fun - Ronald Jenkees This is a weird anomaly for me. I'm usually sort of a purist, meaning I usually like "real" instruments (read: guitars). I'm just not an electronic music kind of person. But I love Ronald Jenkees, and I love this song. Check out the electronicssssss!!!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnW35UDmWOI Manchasm - Future of the Left This song is weird, bizarre, strange, odd, and glorious. Future of the Left has the habit of throwing out these random names (C'MON RICK), and this song introduces us to Mark Foley.

> Mark Foley was right There are no ghosts in this town There is no reason to fear There are no obstacles here

Later in the song, we learn that Collin is a pussy. A very pretty pussy cat. To be honest, I have no flippin' clue what this song is about. But I don't care. It's highly amusing to me. It's "special". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1\_XbYz9J4W0
