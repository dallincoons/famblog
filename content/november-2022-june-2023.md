In November we travelled to visit Owasso, Oklahoma to visit Janae and go house viewing. Calvin got to play with his cousins and we got a reprieve from the bitter Rexburg winter. The fact that we could actually go outside for more than 5 minutes without cursing our very existence was a good sign (also with the way the housing market was going in Idaho, pay a premium for the priveledge).

We celebrated Calvin's 3rd birthday, and not too surprisingly vehicles were the main theme.

Just a few weeks after flying to Oklahoma to check it out, we arrived with our stuff. What's fun about our move is we got Covid right when we were supposed to be packing. FUN, JUST FUN.

We weren't able to move in right away because the house smelled distinctly of dog piss, so unfortunately we spent our first few days deep cleaning. Thankfully, Janae and Mark were able and willing to help us.

\[To recreate the scene, sniff some dog pee\]

Being able to go outside in the winter was such a pleasant change of pace and we tried to take advantage as much as we could.

Calvin missed Rexburg for a while and would often tell us, but we found some fun winter activities for him to enjoy here, like car shows and a thing called "wheels and thrills":

Calvin also loves grocery shopping. By grocery shopping I mean playing with the cars at the grocery store.

We've been busy doing boring house crap that respectable adults do that I don't really want to talk about because I don't really want to join that exclusive club for respectable boring people. Suffice it to say we have been busy painting, m'kay? I'm fighting to retain my youth, damnit!

Here's my recap of Spring. It rains a lot, it's really flat and sometimes you have to drive a ways for a raucous good time at a punk rock show.

Speaking of a racous good time, we planted a garden.

Calvin sometimes helps with the yardwork.

In April we visited Utah to see family. Calvin got to change a tire.

And vist an aquarium.

This is one of Calvin's favorite places in the backyard for obvious reasons.

In conclusion, here's some cute pictures of Calvin with cousins.
