We don't go to as many car shows as we once did, as Calvin seems to have lost interest in them somewhat, but every now and then we make it out.

Calvin is growing up fast, but I'm glad that there are things that remain the same to help keep the illusion that he's not going to become a snotty teenager someday soon. Cars remain the main pastime around here.

Here's what Calvin calls his "time warp".
![timewarp](timewarp.jpg)

Grandpa Kevin and Grandma Melly visited, and Calvin bonded with Grandpa Kevin showing off his Hot Wheel cars while Grandpa guessed what they were.

We got him a doll to play with, and sometimes he plays parent and practices his nurturing skills.

He likes to "fix stuff", such as the bumblebee at the neighborhood park.

While he still had his trike, he was carrying tools in the basket in case he needed to fix anything.

We recently upgraded his trike to a two-wheel bike, which is one of those sad "end of an era" moments. But the good news is, he loves his new bike. It's much easier to get from point A to point B, than with the trike which was beginning to be much too small.

We're always scanning for fire hydrants to sit on.

We discovered a pretty nifty spot in Tulsa. The concept is a coffee shop full of real life kitties.

I think Emily enjoyed the cats the most; Calvin's favorite part was making silly faces.

Calvin has been practicing his silly faces and has become quite proficient.

I'm not really sure what to tell you about these next two.

We tried to catch a leprechaun this year. They got away again but left some fun treats.

My sister Megan and I met up in New Orleans to do whatever it is people do in New Orleans. We ate some good food, saw a parade, ate some good food, rode some streetcards, toured a swamp, said hello to some gators, and ate some good food.

We were there about a week after Mardi Gras season ended. They had to reschedule a parade due to high winds, which meant we were able to attend. This was the most fun parade I've ever attended in my life; there was a joyous, party atmosphere of a superior quality - they just make 'em better in 'nawlins. Apparently parades are so plentiful in New Orleans that they come with themes. This particular parade's theme was dogs.

This made me want to go back for Mardi Gras and experience the madness in its full glory.

Aunt Cassi flew from Utah to visit us. We went to the Philbrook Museum and saw a Samarai exhibit, ate lunch and then colored. I attempted to do some origami, and yeah, turns out it's difficult.

If you have a trampoline in Oklahoma, you have to secure it to the ground. Otherwise this happens.

We've had some pretty wild storms this year. This one was the latest. We were woken up around 7 AM to an emergency alert telling us to keep away from windows. From the sound coming from outside, I took that seriously and headed to the bathroom. Everything turned out ok for us, but our mailbox got wacked by that trampoline.

We traveled to Bentonville, Arkansas to go to a children's museum, where we stayed over 5 hours. Bentonville seems like a nice town. I think I might get tired of Walmart being the center of attention though (this is birthplace and current headquarters of Walmart).

Thanks to everyone who donated to St Judes for this year's Trik-a-thon. Calvin got to ride his new bike, which he was excited about.

We're in shock that this day is already here, but Calvin has officially graduated PreK. We're grateful for the Wee Angels program he has been attending the past two years. He was so nervous at the beginning of each school year, but soon grew to love it. Now it's on to Kindergarten.

Speaking of school, Emily made it through her first semester since going "back to school". If you didn't know, her goal is to become a therapist. She took two classes this year - no small feat when you're a full-time parent to a toddler and juggling contract work as a product packaging designer.

M'kay have some cute pictures.
