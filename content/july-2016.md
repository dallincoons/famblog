We kicked off July with trip to Huntington Beach California, which is where Emily's grandparents are from. ![IMG_0220](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0220.jpg) ![IMG_0257](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0257.jpg) Despite the fact that we were at a beach, which is supposed to supposed to be always warm and sunny, it was cold and windy. ![IMG_0235](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0235.jpg) Some took drastic measures: ![IMG_0259](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0259.jpg) ![IMG_0933](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_0933.jpg) ![IMG_1001](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1001.jpg) ![IMG_0215](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0215.jpg) There were certain people we didn't really care much for...so we buried them. ![IMG_0906](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_0906.jpg) And we forced people at gunpoint to play games: ![IMG_0619](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_0619.jpg) And of course, we partook of the Holy Burger. ![IMG_0264](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0264.jpg) I want to make a pilgrimage to every In-N-Out in existence. Only partially kidding. Several weeks later, we went to my hometown of Lakeside which is by Show Low, or Snowflake maybe  you've heard of it there's a temple there yes it's sort of by Flagstaff I mean it's on the same side of the state at least... Here's where Lakeside is: ![lakesidelocation](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/lakesidelocation.png) It's located right at that bulb syringe. Let's zoom in and take a closer look, shall we? ![IMG_0271](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0271.jpg). There's all kinds of stuff to do in Lakeside. Like farmers markets. ![IMG_0268](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0268.jpg) ![IMG_0269](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_0269.jpg) You can take hipster photographs. ![IMG_1111](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1111.jpg) And there's tons of scenic hikes ![IMG_1091](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1091.jpg) ![IMG_1092](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1092.jpg) The original goal was to go camping. I soon realized that: a) there was a huge fire that almost burned down the whole town, so no campfires were allowed except in designated camping spots. b) you have to pay to camp at designated camping areas. c) I'm not about to pay money for something that is outrageously abundant (although I do pay for bottled water sometimes so it must not bother me that much). Thus we decided to camp in my parents backyard: ![IMG_1119](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1119.jpg) ![IMG_1125](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1125.jpg) Emily woke up to the sound of a hummingbird doing hummingbird things: \[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-y9\_W1kwCs\] It was a great time. I like small towns, ya know? My sister Janae, and her husband Mark "some guy" Johnson, came for a visit. You can check out her [side of the story](https://ourjohnsonadventures.wordpress.com/2016/08/02/july-update/), but I'll tell you how things really went down. We went to Golden Coral. It really isn't the best food in the world, but it has cotton candy and cute kids. ![IMG_1404](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1404.jpg) ![IMG_1402](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1402.jpg) We went to a place called Bookmans that is a playground for nerds. ![IMG_1437](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1437.jpg) We bought Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Ender's Game and the next books in the series: Speaker of the Dead and Xenocide. We also bought the unabridged Les Miserables because we're HARDCORE. And we bought some Harry Potter books (because we're...hardcore?). Reading is frickin' cool. Look at these people: ![IMG_1439](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1439.jpg) We played some crazy games of Cosmic Encounter, in which people are wheelin' and dealin' and you can totally trust me, I have your best interest at heart! ![IMG_1422](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1422.jpg) This is a crazy, crazy, game. I can't repeat the things that I've seen and heard. Well, I finally pulled the trigger (so to speak) and quit my job. Now I will be working from home with a company that uses Laravel.....the best way I can describe it is I'm now able to work with something that is like the Apple product of the PHP programming world. It's sleek, elegant, and generally a joy to work with. I could hardly of asked for anything better. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE                                                   ![IMG_1420](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1420.jpg)   \*The reason the town next to Lakeside is called Show Low is because two guys who were equal partners in a 100,000 acre ranch decided there wasn't room enough for both of them (!) and so they played a game of poker to determine who would get the ranch. During a rousing night of poker, Marion Clark said "If you can show low, win".  Corydon Cooley turned up the deuce of clubs and that was that. He named the settlement Show Low and the main street became the "Deuce of Clubs". Now you know. ![IMG_1045](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_1045.jpg)
