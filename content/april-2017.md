We moved ...again. Here's basically why: this is a decibel reading from our old front door. ![img_2530.png](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_2530-e1494175390130.png?w=747) I think I have a higher than average sensitivity to noise. Even small noises have always bothered me. It's nice to have the fan on when I'm sleeping, but if it makes even the slightest bit of unusual noise, fuh-get-about-it. We lived in a nice Condo, but there was also a lot of variety in noises that you could hear no matter where you were. Whether in the bathroom, in the bedroom, sleeping or pooping, this is what you would hear: RRRRRRRRffffffff...swoosh swoosh swoosh....BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM bllgh blllgggh blllllgggghh swoosh swoosh RRRRR BOOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM.........sweet silence for 8 seconds....VVVRRrooommm........schwump schwump schwump schwump..swoosh tuckaTHUCKtuckaTHUCKtucka BOOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH The nightmare is finally over. We moved to place only a couple minutes away, but my gosh, I am tired of moving. Enough about you, let's talk about us. Emily got her wisdom teeth taken out. It's always very nerve wracking doing anything healthcare related. We essentially roll the dice, and we could end up paying nothing or thousands of dollars, who the hell knows! Luckily this only cost us less than 200 dollars, and now I know what Emily is like as a druggie: ![IMG_0518](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_0518.jpg) Cats suck ![IMG_2375](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_2375.jpg) Even foxes are better ![IMG_5124](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_5124.jpg) Emily went on splits with the missionaries and got to do some street contacting! Missions are really easy. I recently found this letter from my mission, which provided some beautiful, beautiful, reminiscences: [https://dallincoons.wordpress.com/2017/04/16/oakland-mission-chronicles-a-day-in-the-life/](https://dallincoons.wordpress.com/2017/04/16/oakland-mission-chronicles-a-day-in-the-life/) ![IMG_2535](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_2535.jpg) One solution I've been exploring to the noise problem is to try and go deaf! So that's why I attended a couple of shows this month. First off Teenage Bottlerocket. The best Ramones-core band out there! People were jumping around going crazy, and it was a fun time. The drummer recently passed away, and he was the brother of the guitar player featured prominently in the image below. This was the first time they've visited AZ since that time, and you can tell that the band is still grieving but at the same time playing shows seems to be therapeutic. ![IMG_6778](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_6778.jpg) ![IMG_2634](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_2634.jpg) And everyone knows that ska-punk sucks. But real ska is awesome!!! I went and saw The Slackers, who are definitely better than the Beatles. I don't think I've ever been to a real ska show before. It was different. No mosh pits, no stage diving. Just a lot of dancing. It was really fun! ![18238802_10156493455033868_3814646697594666655_o](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/18238802_10156493455033868_3814646697594666655_o.jpg)![18194645_689315077923157_3728725346335779100_n](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/18194645_689315077923157_3728725346335779100_n.jpg)![18157881_689315181256480_8430796006043334604_n](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/18157881_689315181256480_8430796006043334604_n.jpg)![18157132_689314994589832_6404407049579506252_n](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/18157132_689314994589832_6404407049579506252_n.jpg)![18155777_10156493456468868_8153906891041766448_o](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/18155777_10156493456468868_8153906891041766448_o.jpg)                               ![IMG_2537](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_2537.jpg)
