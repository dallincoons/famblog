Welcome to 2025. 

2025 is definitely a number.

Let's not screw around, shall we? Allow me to cut to the chase and post a cute pic.

I spent Christmas home alone, just like during Thanksgiving. I guess I'm getting it outta my system. Emily and Calvin spent it in Utah.

Before they left, we celebrated Christmas a few days before the actual date. The nice thing about doing it on the wrong day is that you can go to Cracker Barrel for Christmas Eve dinner.

Calvin got some new books and legos, which is his new(er) ~~obsession~~ interest.

Muscle Cars is the kind of book that Calvin loves and also the kind that starts to torture me a bit. He loves flipping through each car and naming each one and things about it like the year, engine type, top speed. Then he usually wants me to comment on it in some fashion. It's cute, yet tedious for me. But I know this stage of life will be gone in a blink. I try to keep that in mind and savor every moment.

I spent a good chunk of the Christmas holiday painting. Oh, how exciting.

I mostly got fidget toys for Christmas, which is something I'd never considered as something I'd enjoy, but I've learned that I love them. If I'm sitting around the house I usually have one in my hand.

Emily started classes as the beginning of the journey to becoming a therapist. She's taking some prerequisite classes right now - entry level psychology and statistics.

It snows in Oklahoma by the way. You do have to take advantage of it because it'll be gone in a day or two, which is perfect. Calvin and cousins certainly took advantage of it, and we were glad we bought the snow clothes.

Stevie still likes to eat, sleep and poop.

We visited a coffee shop that indeed has coffee but also has a roomful of cats you can reserve so you can play with the adorable critters.

There were cat themed board games, puzzles, and knockoff "legos" that Calvin had a great time with.
