In March, my parents visited from Arizona. We took them to nowhere Oklahoma to eat some yummy food and go to a museum. The restaurant we were going to go to had an hour-long wait time so we settled for some yummy pizza, with which were not disappointed at all.

Calvin was so nervous when he started preschool last Fall. It was heartbreaking when it was time for him to get out of the car the first day and he was clinging to Mommy and crying. It soon turned into something that he looked forward to each week, and it was a sad affair to have it end. Now he has the summer off and Pre-K to look forward to in the Fall.

Unsurprisingly, car shows are something that Calvin enjoys. Here he is getting to pick out a new car:

He also likes "playing" board games. We just make up some silly rules and he quickly gets tired of it, but also keeps requesting to do it.

And he likes to "fix up" actual cars.

And "garden":

And sit in boxes listening to stories until the sun goes down:

And go to Starbucks with Daddy:

And take cars offroading:

This is the Calvin show.

He started going to Little Kickers which is a soccer class geared towards kids his age, which he seems to like.

We traveled to southern Oklahoma to see a total solar eclipse. We stayed at a nice house with a firepit among lots of other nifty amenities.

Calvin got to spend quality time with family he doesn't get to see in person often enough.

And last but not least, Emily travelled to Dallas to see a band we both love, Deap Vally. It's their farewell tour and this would be a last time to ever get a chance to see them.
