We're sick of doing the same things over and over, so this month we tried something a little different. This month, we played board games and went to music things!!!!11 There's this little band called the Melvins. Never heard of the Melvins? But you've heard of Nirvana I'm sure. Nirvana wouldn't have existed without the Melvins. These guys are legends. Legends who happen to play smallish clubs, including the Crescent Ballroom in downtown Phoenix. One of the reasons I absolutely needed to see them live was to see King Buzzo's hair in all it's magnificent glory. In case you weren't aware, King Buzzo has beautiful, wonderful, magnificent hair and wears strange robes. Wait, hold on, I don't know if I can explain it properly, just take a look for yourselves:         ![kingbuzzo](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kingbuzzo.jpg) What a great human. I desperately want this hairstyle. Curse my slightly curly hair. Also checkout this clip of Buzz trying to buy a house with his street credit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=308&v=HFn1UUI6bj8     After my being severely punished by the Melvins, it was a time for Mr. Stravinsky to punish us with his loud, dissonant, and creepily themed Rite of Spring. I guess people hated it when it first came out, but did Mr. Igor care? Nope, he knew it was great. The guy was a punk rocker. ![IMG_5800](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_5800.jpg) Also, there was a guest violin soloist named Phillipe Qunit who does stuff with a violin I've never seen anyone do before. The guy could really shred. Have a sample, samplers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2D-0ptU1GY   Then we went shopping for dogs, hoping to find the correct select. ![IMG_3363](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_3363.jpg) We found Franky, who didn't bark, but opted for the howl instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-vAKkAvYk&feature=youtu.be   Unfortunately, I don't think our apartment complex is going to allow such a dog, because certain breeds such as Mixed are far too dangerous. In protest, we attended a music thing: One of the greatest rock and roll bands of our generation: The Dirty Nil. Last time we saw them, there were MAYBE 15 people in the audience. Now they're playing to crowds of several hundred. Our little bands are growing up. I can prove the Dirty Nil are on the greatest rock and roll bands, because Luke chews bubblegum while he's playing and singing, and this is a real thing, evidenced by the fact that he blows bubbles while he's doing rock and roll things: ![The-Dirty-Nil_2000-Trees-Festival-2017_SLB_120-1-1024x684](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/the-dirty-nil_2000-trees-festival-2017_slb_120-1-1024x684.jpg) He's very dynamic though, he's not always vaunting his rock and roll maneuvers. He has the ability to bring it down and tell you he don't care about your boyfriend. ![IMG_0281](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_0281.jpg) ![IMG_9078 2](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9078-2.jpg) Then I got to hang out with the Rock n' Roll man himself. I can't believe I forgot to ask him though. What happened to Dave?!!! This is going to haunt me. DAAAAVVVE ![IMG_6852 2](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_6852-2.jpg) Then, what the eeeeeeehhhh, wait is that a UFO?????? ![IMG_5865](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_5865.jpg) ![IMG_9307](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg)   (Not another music thing, I don't want to hear about any more music things!!!) What if I told you, this music thing involved a guy with a Baritone Saxophone and pink hair, a flamboyant trumpet man, and a dude carrying a bass drum. THAT changes everything. Look here's a photograph of this very thing: ![IMG_7344 2](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_7344-2.jpg) Hold on, I'm not one of those jerks who takes pictures in the middle of concerts! And I was too busy dancing, erm jumping around like an idiot. That's right, these guys made me "DANCE". AND I LIKED IT!!!!! The music isn't like anything I've ever heard before, but their genre is self-proclaimed as "Brasshouse". I can't describe, just check out Too Many Zooz playing on a subway train in New York: https://youtu.be/IMyqasy2Lco?t=1m12s This was actually the first time they've ever been to Arizona, and I wasn't sure if they were going to have much of a following, but people were jumping around and going crazy. It was a very good reception, especially for first-timers.   Then we escorted some chick named Princess Leia to a happy place where nobody wants to shoot at you, but we got a bit jammed up, as if we had eaten nothing but cheese and crackers for a week. In the end though it all came out nice and smooth.   ![IMG_9672](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9672.jpg)   As for the rest of the month, it was pretty much "I sat by the computer for hours, programming various things". Oh, what a good blog that would have made.                     ![IMG_9307](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg) ![IMG_9307](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg)![IMG_9307](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg)![IMG_9307](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg)![IMG_9307](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg) ![IMG_9307](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg) ![IMG_9307](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_9307.jpg)
