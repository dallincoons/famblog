Primus show! If you don't know who Primus is, think of an eclectic mix of Rock N Roll, Larry Graham-esque slap bass, and Willy Wonka. It's truly a beautiful thing. If you don't like Primus then, up yours, you silly non-freak person. I met up my buddy Colton who I haven't hung out with in literally 10 years. He's been into Primus as far back as I can remember, but I'm ashamed to say I never got into them. A few years ago I realized I had made a grave mistake, and I have been trying to rectify it ever since. Look, he's real ![IMG_4713](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4713.jpg) We're standing in line to get tickets for the big gig baby. Good thing we got tickets ahead of time because it sold out. Those Primus boys seem to do pretty well for themselves. ![IMG_7588 2](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_7588-2.jpg) During Clutch's set, who was the first band to play, we, unfortunately, positioned ourselves right up front directly in front of a giant speaker, and every time the drummer stomped on the bass pedal, it blew you backward 3 feet. During Primus's set, we moved back a bit - probably too far back but we wanted to get away from The Pounding. Kids, if you don't have tinnitus already, that's a good way to get it, especially if you don't wear earplugs. Primus was great - of course, Primus was great. Everyone knows Primus Sucks\*. \*Primus Sucks means you like Primus in Primus-speak Wow so many pretty lights! ![primusmarquee](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/primusmarquee.jpg) And then we went to St George, Utah to get out of the heat (har har har) ![IMG_8085](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_8085.jpg) ![IMG_8225](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_82251.jpg) Escape Rooms: a fun way to spend a lot of money to feel like an idiot for an hour. ![IMG_6331](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_6331.jpg) ![IMG_9445](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_9445.jpg)   We hung out with Moose, the mammoth dog. ![IMG_5595](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_5595.jpg) Our Sweet Baby ![IMG_3892](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_3892.jpg) ![IMG_1751](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_1751.jpg) I purchased a new Mac because macs are awesome: ![IMG_5409](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_5409.jpg) The sky grows dark and foreboding as the dust descends on the valley ![IMG_4199](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4199.jpg) We didn't save the world. I'm so sorry. ![IMG_1823](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_1823.jpg) Look, we bought a new car with cold hard cash, and remain 100% debt free (yaaaaay) It's an older Camry, a 2003 model with only 84,000 miles on it. Welcome home, car.  I love cars. ![IMG_1299 3](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_1299-3.jpg) Our other, older Camry, randomly got a flat tire. I hate cars. ![IMG_0079](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_0079.jpg) There was something happening to the sun that got everyone riled up. Booooring. ![IMG_6217](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_6217.jpg) Third rainy day of the year, only two more to go. ![IMG_6586](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_6586.jpg) Watching: This Is Us (my little sister made us watch it and it's actually not terrible) Reading: Tech book, tech book, and more tech books Einstein by Walter Isaacson Listening: OMG r u serious I drove to my stupid job today, got stopped at an intersection 15 minutes of my life just rolled away I looked at the guy next to me he didn't seem so happy no ones happy but everyone's too busy to see let's go shopping today drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls and for lunch we'll have Big Macs I wish I could turn the clock back to when i was ten when I wasn't scared of everything and everything wasn't so fetchin' crowded and I wonder if my kids will ever see a horizon untouched by billboards and shopping malls and I wonder if this crazy world thinks i'm the one who's crazy what if i'm the one who's crazy? - 15 Minutes by The Broadways   ![IMG_3813](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_3813.jpg)
