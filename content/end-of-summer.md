Emily has been attending dance class and has been working on a performance inspired by the Barbie movie. Watch the video here and see if you can spot her:

I've been going to Ninja Warrior class that Mark introduced me to which has been a fun (and challenging) way to stay in shape. I was quite bad at it at first but have improved drastically since I started attending which has been rewarding.

We went to a 4th of July parade and poor Calvin is very sensitive to stimulus - the firetruck sirens were too loud. Next time we might bring some noise-cancelling ear muffs.

Calvin has been attending preschool at St Henry Catholic Church twice a week. His cousin Karis is in the same class. For a while, anytime someone asked him how he was feeling about going to preschool he would reply "I'm feeling nervous". He had a hard time leaving Mommy on the first day and had a hard time for the first few days of class thereafter. He seems to have gotten much more comfortable with it and seems genuinely excited about attending. He often asks when he gets to go back to preschool and we have to break it to him that he has to wait, for example for "three more bedtime sleeps".

It might have helped that his classroom sometimes has cars to play with.

Calvin loves a show called Peppa Pig, which he is most familiar with in audio form. There were many days this summer when he would carry around Mommy or Daddy's phone that were playing episodes of Peppa Pig while he played with his cars and trucks. We heard it so much we started thinking in British accents, and Calvin developed a little bit of an accent himself and a few British-isms such as pronouncing tomato 'To-mah-to'.

We made a trip to Dallas, Texas to visit Peppa Pig World.

Calvin loves playing with his toy tools, and we thought it would be fun to go to a Home Depot event where we used real tools to build a treasure chest. It was difficult for his little hands and I put most of it together, but I think he had a good time.

We like going on 'hikes' which are really just nature walks. Calvin likes collecting acorns so he can later "pulverize" them with a rock (he pronounces it "fertilize").

We met up with Janae and Mark's family at the Tulsa State Fair and they had a lot of vehicle-themed rides for the kids which is what we spend the majority of the time doing. It was 90 degrees and fairly humid, and I was fighting a sinus infection so that day kinda kicked my ass but the kids had a blast!

I know you've wondering how many erasers Calvin can fit in his mouth. We investigated and have the answer:

We traveled to Hurri-cuhn, Utah for a little bit of a family reunion thingy. Unfortunately, Grandpa and GranAnn contracted ye olde Covid virus and only made it for the last few days. Among other things we got to explore the sights and eat s'mores. The pool was a big hit for Calvin and we spent most of the time in the concrete-lined vat of blue chlorine water.

We went to a Japanese steak house, which is one of those places where they cook the food in front of you. The first thing our chef did was light the entire grill on fire, which Calvin was super NOT expecting and had a bit of a meltdown. Emily took him outside to detox from the overstimulation, and eventually he calmed down enough to come back inside. He tried sushi - I don't think he was a big fan but I'm proud of him for trying!

We've been frequenting the Botanical Gardens. They have cool plants, but also dinosaurs.

Abrupt ending.
