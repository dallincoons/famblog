What's nifty about where we live is that a berry farm is right down the road where can go pick fresh blueberries and blackberries, but 20 minutes away is a big-ish city.

We're not the best gardeners (yet), but we recently harvested the first thing we've successfully grown. Calvin was pretty excited about that.

We went to a little amusement park about 40 minutes away that is geared toward kids Calvin's age. He rode all the "roller coasters". We always wondered if he was having fun because his facial expression was usually some variation of this:

But every time he got off a ride he raved about how much fun he had and he wanted to go to the "next fing".

Speaking of cool things near us, this is just a few minutes away. We went with Janae and Mark's family, and the kids had fun with all the butterflies that were landing on us. And of course throwing rocks in water is always a big attraction.

It's been getting hotter and we've been ingesting watermelon at record pace. We're on a Whole30 diet in the month of June (Calvin isn't) so fruit is our main source of sweetness. It's amazing how sweet and heavenly fruit is when you're not eating anything with added sugar.

We had Karis over while Janae, Mark, and Leah went to a Broadway show (The Lion King).

We seem to have caught a termite problem early, and this is when I grumble about being a boring suburban person in a home who has to deal with boring, expensive problems like this.

We traveled to Arkansas for a mini vacation that lasted a couple days. We found a fairly inexpensive condo to stay at which is right next to the Ouachita River. Calvin was happy to be able to throw as many rocks as he wanted into the river.

We visited a dollar store on a whim and picked up a logging truck that he loved playing with for the entirety of our stay.

We spend some time at a gorgeous lake where Calvin found a caterpillar to play with and was able to spend some quality time with his "diggers". I have to say I have a newfound respect for Arkansas. That was a state that was always a black hole in my mind, meaning something I couldn't picture. I'm already thinking about the other states we're going to visit next. The fun thing about Oklahoma is it's in the center of everything and there are so many feasible possibilities.

And Calvin is starting swim lessons with his cousin Karis.
