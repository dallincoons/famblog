I'm sure you noticed that I haven't written in a couple months, and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry to ruin 2017 for you! If you can't function at full capacity I totally understand. Boy howdy, what an eventful couple of months. Sit back, your feet up, and let me tell you all about it. First, Emily quit her job because, well, it's quite the story so you should ask her if you're dying to know. My little sister came to visit around the Thanksgiving holiday, and we took her to the amazing Joe's Italian Ice. ![IMG_2402 2](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_2402-2.jpg)   It's pretty cool, it has a lot of vintage stuff like telephones that transmit signals through telephone lines, lololol. ![IMG_1747](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_1747.jpg) And she brought her child and left her husband at home. ![IMG_9399](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_9399.jpg) If anyone wants to come visit, that could be you too! Its sunny and warm here, you know you want tooooo. Then we headed out to California to celebrate Thanksgiving with Emily's grandparents, and caught some rays at the same time, which is obviously the best way to celebrate Thanksgiving. ![IMG_6595](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6595.jpg)![IMG_9797 2](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_9797-2.jpg) I unexpectedly got a phone call from a prospective employer, and things were going great..until I learned it's essentially a porn company. I said no thanks. ![IMG_3437](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3437.jpg) ![IMG_3846](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3846.jpg) Sometime after we got back we went and did service at Feed My Starving children once again, which I highly recommend as a great way to do some service and feed some starving children. It pretty much consists of spending an hour packaging up food to be shipped off to third world countries. ![IMG_5139](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_5139.jpg) We headed off to Utah to attend a Lower Lights concert. ![IMG_5833](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_5833.jpg) ![IMG_0672](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0672.jpg) Random airplane guy and I are study buddies! ![IMG_8834](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_8834.jpg) They look happy, but they're freezing and sad ![IMG_4564](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_4564.jpg) Midnight I-Hop run for some reason (I'm getting too old for this kind of thing). ![IMG_6757](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6757.jpg) ![IMG_6073](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6073.jpg) Behold, our Christmas decorations. That's about the extent of it: ![IMG_3837](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3837.jpg) We spent Christmas in Lakeside with my parents. It was super relaxing and enjoyable. ![IMG_0267 2.JPG](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0267-2.jpg?w=8064) Then we went and visited the house where I lived for the first 11 years of my life in Podunk, AZ. The house is a shell of its former glory. There used to be a beautiful green lawn with rose bushes, and I don't remember the siding looking like crap, and oh well, ![IMG_8808](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_8808.jpg) This is seriously one of Emily's favorite things of all time: big open sky. ![IMG_0604](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0604.jpg) Taco Bell is good and I'm sexy ![IMG_1042](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_1042.jpg) We traveled to Northern Utah to visit Emily family for "Step Christmas" which is pretty much just Christmas a week after actual Christmas day. We used to do long 12-hour drives but these days it just seems so..long. We decided to stop on our way to Utah someone's house courtesy of Airbnb in Kanab, UT and discovered they have an awesome dog! (I'm accepting sponsorship from Airbnb if any representatives happen to see this) ![IMG_8890](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_8890.jpg) Dogs are cool ![IMG_0313](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0313.jpg) We like dogs ![IMG_0314](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0314.jpg) Someone else likes dogs too ![IMG_3413](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3413.png) Somewhere along the way, we took a picture of a rock ![IMG_0290](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0290.jpg) There's this whole tradition thing where we go to the store on Christmas Eve (or Step Christmas Eve) and get cereal. I got Fruit Gushers because nobody is stopping me and I'm like, an adult, and Fruit Gushers are reeeal good. (I'm accepting Fruit Gushers sponsorship if anyone from there is reading this.) ![IMG_9369](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_9369.jpg) Step-Christmas morning ![IMG_0320](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0320.jpg) Pacman makes a great stock stuffer by the way. PRO TIP ![IMG_8045](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_8045.jpg) Go to Cupbop in Utah, it's really good Korean barbeque. I can't remember where it's located though. I think it's in the city with all the Mormons. ![IMG_6963](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6963.jpg) On the way back from Step-Christmas we visited Monument Valley. It was reeeally quiiiet. Just the way I like it. ![IMG_0357](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0357.jpg) And we stayed in a cozy little cottage thingy ![IMG_0347](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0347.jpg) And this thing is where I want to live someday: ![IMG_0349](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0349.jpg) I saw a little up and coming band called the Descendants (lolololol) best known for their hit singles _I'm Not a Loser_, _I Like Food_ and _My Dad Sucks_. They actually don't tour much because their singer, Milo, is a biochemist by trade and doesn't generally have a lot of time to play punk rock shows these days. However, they've been playing weekend shows all across the country for several months now, and they graced Arizona with their presence. They're all getting old, pushing 60, but they're still a bunch of goofballs, which is fitting for a band who has an album called I Don't Want to Grow Up, and often sing about how boring old people are. It's all very inspirational. ![IMG_6124](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_6124.jpg) Oh and I was poisoned by some meat I ate. Do vegetarians eat at Sweet Tomatoes every day or something, cause that's what I'm going to do. (I'm accepting sponsorship from Sweet Tomatoes, just saying) ![IMG_0220](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0220.jpg)                                       ![IMG_7277](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_7277.jpg)                                                   ![IMG_0327](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_0327.jpg)                                                 ![IMG_7840](https://dallincoons.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_78401.jpg)
