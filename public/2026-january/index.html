    <p>It gets cold in Oklahoma occasionally. When it snows, people freak out, people raid the grocery stores and schools shut down. That lasts about a week and then the snow melts and it warms up and we go back to regular programming.</p>
<p>We did have a pretty decent snowstorm. Calvin was very excited for the snow. He was disappointed that there wasn&rsquo;t any in Utah when they visited for Christmas.</p>

<p>We went sledding multiple days in a row.</p>

<p>Calvin generally doesn&rsquo;t seem to be bothered too much by the cold and the snow. It does help that he (and Emily) have warm clothes. For some reason, I don&rsquo;t, which is a bit strange given how much time we spent in Rexburg.</p>

<p>Living the dream.

<p>Before it snowed, we went on a tour the new additions to the Botanic Gardens. It was bitterly cold and windy, but we got some hot chocolate and made the best of it.</p>

<p>Calvin had almost a week of &ldquo;distance learning&rdquo;, which was just about an hour a day of a teacher somehow wrangling a class that&rsquo;s only present through screens. That seems miraculous to me – and there&rsquo;s a reason I&rsquo;m not a teacher. Here&rsquo;s Calvin doing head, shoulders, knees and toes.

<p>We play a lot of Mario Kart around here. We&rsquo;ve set a limit so that Calvin can only play 3 sets of races a day. He&rsquo;s getting really good at it. When he first started playing he was just happy to be there. Now he gets competitive and it can get kind of annoying. But we&rsquo;re trying to teach him to lose gracefully.

<p>Calvin has always seemed to have alter egos. Right now, he&rsquo;s in old man mode.
